# python-home-server Â» a simple command line home server.

This python-home-server called "ultron-server" is a simple command line server. It can be used by users who enjoy coding in python and have fun by adding new features to it. The server itself uses encryption to handle files between the client. Available options are described in the help section of uc.py. Ultron-server has the possibility to server as a package manager where the user can create packages which he needs on his devices. The packages will be downloaded and integrated in the system.  

# Setup:

- run the server-setup.py and cleint-setup.py script. It will create the private key for encryption and generates the user token for authentication.

- now you can run the server by executing the command *us* and the client by executing the command *uc* 

- the server script will create an err_log.txt file for errors occurred during runtime
  and a conn_log.txt file for logging incoming connections.

- usi.py is an optional security file. It creates integrities of the files key.txt, token.txt and valid_token.txt.
  Therefore it can be excluded if these files have been compromised.
